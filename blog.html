    <h1>ADARAK CHAI</h1>

    <p class="para">A delicious, warming Indian Ginger Tea made with fresh ginger roots, tea leaves and milk. This tea has a wonderful aroma and will have you coming back for more! It also includes many health benefits and can be made in just 15 minutes. Serve plain or with Indian snacks like pakoras, aloo tikki, vegetable cutlet, medu vada, or samosas.
        Ginger tea is very popular in India and is a favorite chai of many Indians other than Masala Chai. It is known as Adrak chai or Adrak wali chai in India. As ginger is called as ‘adrak’ in Hindi language.

Tea is made in most Indian homes. Generally it is made with dairy milk. For vegan you can opt to use cashew milk, soy milk, almond milk or oats milk to make vegan ginger tea.
When using any plant based milk heat them separately until hot but not boiling and add it to the hot tea concoction. Mix and switch off the heat.

For a plant based tea I suggest to use cashew milk because it is smooth, rich and compliments the tea so well that you won’t even notice that it’s plant-based tea!

You can also leave out adding any milk to make this tea. I know many folks who love their ginger tea without milk.

    <h1>MINT TEA</h1>

                <p class="para">Mint tea is a traditional tea that’s celebrated in many cultures, including Morocco. Consisting of mint, green tea leaves, and sugar, mint tea can be enjoyed at all times of the day and is commonly served to guests in Moroccan culture.
                    Fresh mint leaves give this mint tea recipe an alluring herbal aroma and flavor. Since this tea is made with an herb instead of tea leaves, it is considered an herbal tea or tisane and does not contain any caffeine. You can enjoy a cup of mint tea before bed without worries about it keeping you up.

                    You can vary the mint in this recipe as long as it's fresh. Peppermint or spearmint are classic choices, but other varieties will work just as well. You can even use a mixture of them. While you can use dried mint for tea, it doesn't compare to the flavor of fresh herbs. Serve it hot or iced, sweetened or unsweetened, and with or without lemon. It's easy to adjust to your taste and customize to each drinker.
                    
                    If you love mint tea but prefer a caffeinated beverage, Moroccan mint tea made with a blend of green tea ​(that has caffeine) and mint leaves might be just the ticket. For a summer quencher, consider an ​​iced tea recipe.

                    It is quite natural for us to add a few home herbs and spices to most of our dishes, especially in winter. The reason for this being, these spices like ginger, pepper, basil, cloves all have medicinal value. It is not really a hard and fast rule of how much or how little of these you add. It is pretty much what the family loves.
                    When it comes to winter, the soothing effects of basil leaves are the ones I rely on for those itchy throats. I could really say this has become a cool-weather staple. The combination of tulsi (basil) and jaggery for ages has been one of the best lozenges ever. Then add in the familiarity of tea and these medicinal effects are quickly translated into comfort. As much as I will love to get the Indian basil to add to this recipe, the Italian basil works well too.  So here we are with this simple recipe and a soothing cup of tea2
